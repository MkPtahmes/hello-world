# hello-world
My first project
I have used the PC since their very beginning, and gone through each iteration of OS, various Productivity Suites, and Connectivity. Now my interest lies in building Developer skills. These early 'hello-world' lessons have shown me that much of what I've learned, especially in Windows and Office are actually built upon the principles herein; just with different names of the functions performed by end-user consumers such as: save (commit), save as (branch)...and so on.
